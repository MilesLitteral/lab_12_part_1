<h1>The Deep South</h1> <p>Who are you, my warranty?! Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates&hellip; PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid.</p> <h2>The Cyber House Rules</h2> <p>Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Why did you bring us here? Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. I don't want to be rescued. Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very&hellip;</p> <ul> <li>Bender, quit destroying the universe!</li> <li>Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?</li> <li>These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.</li> </ul> <h3>The Problem With Popplers</h3> <p>Large bet on myself in round one. It must be wonderful. I'll get my kit! I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. I can explain. It's very valuable.</p> <h4>Spanish Fry</h4> <p>Hey, guess what you're accessories to. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.</p> <ol> <li>Hey, guess what you're accessories to.</li> <li>It must be wonderful.</li> <li>Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.</li> </ol> <h5>War Is the H-Word</h5> <p>Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Take me to your leader!</p>
